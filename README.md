============================

Remove PDF Metadata in OSX.

## Why Remove PDF Metadata? ##
There could be many reasons that a person might want to remove metadata, but our most recent example was to submit a paper for blind review. Even though we made sure the actual content of our PDF did not have our names, the metadata still had the author names.

## Instructions ##
1. Download the ZIP of this project from the button above that has the cloud and the arrow and "ZIP."
1. Unzip the download
1. Rename it to remove "-master" so that it ends in .app
1. Drag a pdf onto this app, that pdf will have its metadata (such as author names) removed.
